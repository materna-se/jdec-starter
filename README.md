jDEC is a Java library designed to provide a unified interface for executing decisions. The decisions can be modeled with [DMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN) (Decision Model and Notation) or with Java. This starter shows exemplarily how jDEC can be used to execute a decision within a fictitious business process.
